# About Recommender Systems

Over the past few decades, platforms like YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix have made recommender systems an essential part of our online experience. Whether it’s suggesting movies to watch, products to buy, or articles to read, these systems help users discover content that matches their interests.

In simple terms, a recommender system is an algorithm that predicts what a user might like based on their preferences and behavior. They play a key role in many industries — not only improving user experience but also driving significant revenue and helping companies stand out from the competition.
